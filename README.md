![Creating a page to display UFO sightings.](https://github.com/AgapeofIcarus/javascript-challenge/blob/main/UFO-Level-1/static/images/stars.jpg?raw=true)

In this project for UNCC Data Analytics Bootcamp, we have information supporting the existence of UFOs and various sightings. The objective is to create a functional page with a form and button that allows for filtered data.
